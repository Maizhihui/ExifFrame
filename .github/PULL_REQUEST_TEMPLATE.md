> To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and link the issue in the pull request. ***Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause.*** Be sure to follow our Coding Guidelines and keep code changes as ***small*** as possible. Avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified otherwise. Pull requests should contain tests whenever possible.
